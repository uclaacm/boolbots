## FAQs

### Husky is yelling at me and not letting me commit :(

Add the `-n` flag to your commit message to skip Husky's auto-linting.

EG: `git commit -m "changes" -n`

### Assets are angry and won't accept <x filetype>
Our webpack set-up currently accepts asset files with the following extensions: `png, svg, jpg/jpeg, gif, mp3, ttf`

Code for it can be seen in line 22 `webpack.dev.js` and in `webpack.prod.js`

```
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpe?g|gif|mp3|ttf)$/i, // we use regex to test different file types
        use: {
          loader: 'file-loader',
          options: {
            name: 'assets/[name].[ext]',
          },
        },
      },
```

If you want to add more assets like `.pdf`, `.wav`, `.mp4`, <YOUR_ASSET_TYPE> etc.

- [ ] Update `webpack.dev.js` file. Change `test: /\.(png|svg|jpe?g|gif|mp3)$/i` to `test: /\.(png|svg|jpe?g|gif|mp3|<YOUR_ASSET_TYPE>)$/i`
- [ ] Update `webpack.prod.js` file. Change `test: /\.(png|svg|jpe?g|gif|mp3)$/i,` to `test: /\.(png|svg|jpe?g|gif|mp3|<YOUR_ASSET_TYPE>)$/i`
- [ ] (If typing is needed) add a folder under `custom_typing` => `import-<YOUR_ASSET_TYPE>`
- [ ] (If typing is needed) create a file like `import-<YOUR_ASSET_TYPE>.d.ts`
- [ ] (If typing is needed) add in:

```
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */
declare module '*.<YOUR_ASSET_TYPE>' {
  const value: <YOUR_ASSET_TYPE-TYPE>;
  export default value;
}
```
      
### How can I tell if my asset is actually being served?

## Overview

... explain what your project is here! What technology you used, who made it, and what it was for!

## Development Setup

We'll use a really common Node.js project workflow + Yarn!
First, let's clone our repository, and install all of our yarn dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/boolbots.git
cd boolbots
```

If you don't have yarn installed...

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Then install our dependencies!

```
yarn install
yarn prepare
```

(If the above commands don't work even after installing yarn via npm, check this [npm installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable), click on alternatives, choose your operating system, and follow the steps there!)

(We handle the yarn and npm conflict issues within our `.gitignore` we set up so dw about it!)
To start our app, you just need to run `yarn start`!

```
yarn start
```

And to build our project for production (with CRA and Webpack's bundling with all that goodness),

```
yarn run build
```

## Contribution Workflow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to BoolBots! ❤️

Here's a quick guide on how to get started.

1. Either make a new branch or a fork of this repository. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
2. Follow the instructions in "Development Setup" above. If you're on a fork, replace the URL with the fork's URL; if you're on a different branch, check it out using `git checkout`.
3. Beep boop away!
4. **Before you push**, make sure your app runs with `yarn start`. If there are any errors, our CI/CD service will **reject your build**.
5. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes!
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/uclaacm/boolbots/pulls) with your changes, and let someone on your project team know.
   a. Netlify has a neat feature called "Deploy Previews" that give you a link to preview your changes; [see the blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) for more info!
7. If your code passes code review, then we can merge it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch/fork.

## Helpful Commands

By running `yarn lint-fix` we can use the linter that we set-up to format our code the way that passes our style checks! Before you commit your changes and submit a pull request, make sure to run

```
yarn lint-fix
```

With Husky, we run `yarn lint-staged` automatically before you commit! If you want to lint before commiting, you can run `yarn lint-fix`.

- Preloading Images - if rendering images gets annoying because it's slow: [Link Example here](https://github.com/uclaacm/Playnet/blob/c2414e7d1179eb11af6b4a49047ab3d8fb9aed66/src/components/shared/Preload.tsx)
